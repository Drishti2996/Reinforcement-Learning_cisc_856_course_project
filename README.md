Replication Of The paper "A complementary learning systems approach to temporal difference learning"

This repository is a course project for the graduate course of <b>Reinforcement Learning</b>.
The project is a replication of the paper titled <b>“A Complementary Learning Systems Approach to Temporal Difference Learning” </b> by Blakeman et al *
In a nutshell, this paper discusses criticism of current RL as inefficient and lacking flexibility And introduces us to a new algorithm motivated by “complementary learning system.”

In our project, we have implemented two algorithms DQN and CTDL and compared their performance. The algorithms are implemented for Gridworld and Cartpole environments.
The repository consistes of three ".py" files. 
1. <b>gridworld_dqn_ctdl.py</b> - it consists of the code for DQN and CTDL algorithm for gridworld environment. To run CTDL you need to uncomment the code that calls the CTDL at the end of the file, and do the same thing to run the DQN.
2. <b>cartpole_dqn.py </b> - it consists of the code for cartpole environment using DQN algorithm.
3. <b>cartpole_ctdl.py</b> - it consists of code for cartpole environment using CTDL algorithm.

We have also included the paper that we have replicated along with our project report.
